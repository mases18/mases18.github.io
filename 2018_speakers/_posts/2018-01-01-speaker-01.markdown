 Gaël Varoquaux is a tenured computer-science researcher at INRIA. His research develops statistical learning tools for functional neuroimaging data with application to mapping brain of cognition and pathologies. In addition, he is heavily invested in software development for data science, as project-lead for scikit-learn, one of the reference machine-learning toolboxes, and on joblib, Mayavi, and nilearn. Varoquaux has contributed key methods for functional brain atlasing, extracting brain connectomes, population studies, as well as efficient models for high-dimensional data-scarce machine learning beyond brain imaging. He has a PhD in quantum physics and is a graduate from Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris.
